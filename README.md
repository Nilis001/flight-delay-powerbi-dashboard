Interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing flight delays with KPIs, trends, and route performance insights.
# ✈️ Flight Delay Analysis & Dashboard  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes **US Flight Delay Data** and builds both **Excel** and **Power BI dashboards** to uncover insights about flight performance, delay patterns, and operational bottlenecks.  

I first explored the dataset in Excel and then developed an interactive Power BI dashboard with a professional theme to visualize key KPIs.

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset contains flight records with the following columns:  

- **ID** → Record ID  
- **DATOP** → Date of flight  
- **FLTID** → Flight ID  
- **DEPSTN** → Departure Airport  
- **ARRSTN** → Arrival Airport  
- **STD** → Scheduled Time of Departure  
- **STA** → Scheduled Time of Arrival  
- **STATUS** → Flight Status  
- **AC** → Aircraft Code  
- **target** → Delay in minutes

## 📊 Dashboard Features  
- ✅ Total Flights & Delayed Flights KPIs  
- ✅ Delay Percentage vs. On-time Flights  
- ✅ Delays Over Time (Line Chart)  
- ✅ Top 10 Airports by Delays (Bar Chart)  
- ✅ Delays by Aircraft (Tree Map)  
- ✅ Gauge Chart showing performance vs. 20% benchmark  
- ✅ Year Slicer for interactive exploration

## 🔍 Key Insights  
- Flight delays vary significantly by month, with **January showing over 44 delays** in the dataset.  
- Certain aircraft and routes contribute disproportionately to delays.  
- Performance compared against the **20% industry benchmark** highlights areas needing operational improvement.

## 🛠 Tools Used  
- **Excel** (exploratory dashboard)  
- **Power BI** (interactive professional dashboard)  
- **DAX** (measures for KPIs and delay percentages)
